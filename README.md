# music-project-main / Lyrific

## Description

Our team loves music, so we decided to make an app targeting the users who love music like we do... karaoke singers. Wanting to implement historical music data as well as live music trending data we employed two APIs: Last.FM and Musixmatch. With this data our users can view the top songs of that moment, but also easily find and read their lyrics. The search feature doesn't stop there, you can search any artist or song in the Musixmatch database and see their lyrics as well.

We saw and met many challenges in this development project. Finding just the right API to match up with was our first challenge. Our second was dealing with Github, and was our main takeaway lesson of the importance of version control. We all look forward to improving this critical skill to streamline our projects.

## Installation

There is nothing to install for this application, simply visit out github site: <https://dereklewis.github.io/music-project-main/>

## Usage

Lyrific is a very simple, but complex web application. Use the top navigation bar links to navigate your way down the page. Click the "About" link to learn about Lyrific itself. Click the "Today's Top Ten" link to view the top ten songs at that very moment (try it again next week and it might be COMPLETELY different). Or select the "Lyrics" link (or the get started button) to be taken to the Lyrific search tool. Select to search for an artist and view their albums, navigate to their songs, and access lyrics; or search for a specific song and view its lyrics immediately.

For example a user might:

1. Click the Today's Top 10 link and be taken to the most popular songs of today.
2. Select the newest Olivia Rodrigo from the list and type the song name into the Search field. NOTE: Direct Linking coming in a future release.
3. Choose the song radio and click Search.
4. Find the results returned instantaneously, and select the Click Here for Lyrics button.
5. Find the lyrics presented in front of them and begin Karaoke preparation.
